# UTKPhys-YETI2025

My tool!: PhysX (Physics+Extensions)

-The idea behind this was just to make some tools I always think would be helpful to be on hand while doing research/teaching/reading/making powerpoints and so on. I wasn't comfortable putting this on a browser store yet so I think the best way to test it would be in Chrome. The directions to do so are as follows
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Select developer mode
3. Load unpacked - choose the physics-extension folder
4. Make sure it is enabled in the toolbar
5. Right click on the icon in the toolbar and press open sidepanel

-The tools are as follows. 
1. A unit converter - lets you convert between units and returns the result with up to six decimal places. Choose from a number of categories. (I did as many as I could but this is easily expandable)
2. A LaTeX renderer/converter. Allows you to type LaTeX code and return a downloadable jpeg or SVG or png. I find things like this very useful when making powerpoints. Also allows you to search for certain equations (also expandable). A few of the ones I did were kinematics equations, the Coulomb force equation, the gravitational force equation, Schrodinger's time dependent/independent equations. Lets you hover and see terms in equations.
3. An arXiv search button.  Lets you search for authors and articles pertaining to a certain topic and gives results. You are able to cite/save the references. I find this useful when I'm already reading a paper and want to look up the citations and save them without opening new tabs. 

-Note that all of these are tools that exist already but this saves tab spaces and lets you do things more quickly. 
My To Do List for stuff I want to add 
1. Adding more of a glossary/explanation of terms and equations to the LaTeX renderer. Useful for just quick reading.
2. Making the citation format more pleasing/accurate.
3. Making a nicer place to view saved arXiv articles (folders you can save in). 
4. A date reference/more filters for the arXiv search as well as pagination + reverse chronological order.
5. Dark mode because it's superior

The file structure is as follows:

There are also a number of easter eggs. I think it is more fun to find them yourself, but a full list can be found in easter.txt.
